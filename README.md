# Prairie-Restoration-Experiment-BaylesRoad
Multiple datasets measured during a multiple-year prairie restoration field experiment and accompanying analysis/plotting scripts.

This includes all data (other than the raw sequencing reads that are available through NCBI's SRA database as accession SRP114552 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRP114552">here</a>) and the analysis and plotting scripts used in the manuscript:

These data and analyses are published in: House and Bever <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/rec.12924">"*Biochar soil amendments in prairie restorations do not interfere with benefits from inoculation with native arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi*"</a>. Restoration Ecology (2019) doi:10.1111/rec.12924
